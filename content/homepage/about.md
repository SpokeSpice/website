SpokeSpice is an open hardware project that is comprised of a controller board and a number of arms.
It can display patterns and animations on the spokes of a bicycle wheel.

A magnet that is attached to the fork of the wheels is detected by the arms that swipe underneath it.
This allows the system to synchronize the display with the rotation of the wheel.
